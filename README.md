# Operators-Assignment-Submission
Employee class: Defines an employee with Id, FirstName, and LastName properties.
Operator overloading: The == and != operators are overloaded to compare two Employee objects by their Id.
Equals and GetHashCode: These methods are overridden to maintain consistency with the overloaded operators.
Program.cs: This file instantiates two Employee objects, assigns values, compares them using the == operator, and outputs whether they are equal based on their Id.
